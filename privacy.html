                        Information We Get From Others. We may get information about you from other sources. For example, you can upload contacts from your email provider so that we can notify you when people you know create profiles on Kimera.

                        Cookies. We may log information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your device by a website.

We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.

                    <h1 class="left"> HOW WE SHARE THIS INFORMATION</h1>
                    <p>
                        We may share your personal information as follows:
                        Third Parties Designated by You. We may share your personal information with third parties where you have provided your consent to do so.
                        Our Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who provide services such as data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure, email delivery, and other similar services.

                    <h1 class="left">ANONYMOUS DATA</h1>
                    <p>
                        When we use the term "anonymous data," we’re referring to data and information that doesn’t permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.
                        We may create anonymous data from the personal information we receive about you and other individuals whose personal information we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make personal information into anonymous data by excluding information, such as your name, that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our sites.
                    </p><h1 class="left">INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PUBLICLY VISIBLE</h1>
                    <p>
                        No information about you will be public on Kimera in its present iteration. Should the status of your personal information being not public change as a result of an updated site, we will notify you and provide instruction for appropriate opt-out of our services.
                        We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information, on our sites.
                    </p><h1 class="left">COOKIES</h1>
                    <p>
                        We use several types of cookies on our sites:
                        Essential Cookies. These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our sites. For example, when you sign in to our sites, we may send cookies to your device so that we can identify you as a user.
                        Functionality Cookies. These cookies are used to remember choices you make when you use our sites, such as your country. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience.
                        Analytics and Performance Cookies. These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our sites and how users use the sites. The information is aggregated and anonymous and does not identify any individual visitor. It includes the number of visitors to our sites, the pages they visited, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate, maintain, and improve our sites.
                        Social Media Cookies. These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button on our sites or engage with our content on or through a social network such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this.
                    </p><h1 class="left">ONLINE TRACKING OPT-OUT GUIDE</h1>
                    <p>
                        Like many companies online, we may use services provided by Google and other companies that rely on technologies — such as cookies and web beacons — to collect information directly from your device about your browsing activities, your interactions with websites, and the device you're using to connect to the Internet. There are a number of ways to opt-out of having your online activity and device data collected through these services, which we have summarized below:
                        Blocking cookies in your browser. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you remove or reject our cookies, it could affect how our sites work for you.
                        Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings. Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising. Please check the instructions for your operating system: iOS or Android.
                        Using privacy plug-ins or browsers. You can block our websites from setting cookies used for interest-based advertising by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or by installing browser plugins that block third-party cookies and trackers.
                        Platform opt-outs. The following advertising partners offer features that let you opt-out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising:
                        Google. https: //adssettings.google.com
                        Facebook. https: //www.facebook.com/about/ads
                        AppNexus. https: //platform.xandr.com/privacy-center/opt_out
                        Rakuten Advertising. https: //rakutenadvertising.com/legal-notices/services-privacy-rights-request-form/
                        Advertising industry opt-out tools. You can also use these opt-out options to limit use of your information for interest-based advertising by participating companies. Because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt-out on every browser and device that you use.

                    <p>
                        We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. These purposes may include satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements; establishing or defending legal claims; or fraud prevention.
                        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information; the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.
                        When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
                    </p><h1 class="left">INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</h1>
                    <p>
                        Your information, including personal information that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using our sites, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                        We will only process your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

                    </p><h1 class="left">SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
