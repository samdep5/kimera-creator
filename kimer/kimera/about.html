                    We offer a discovery engine to empower the dreams of creators by connecting them with their fans authentically that no other platform can.
                    <br><br>
                    Our founding team is a scrappy group of writers, video creators, and innovators based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as Harvard sophomores. We've spent most of 2021 venturing across the country to traverse the creator economy&#8212; from the coast of Oregon and the plains of Texas to the streets of LA and Boston.
                    <br><br>
                    Before Kimera, we were launching Boundless Media, a YouTube startup that filmed wild challenges and our travel around America.
                    <br><br>
                    This experience changed everything.
                    <br><br>
                    When we crashed our car after filming in a blizzard, we realized creators need a better way to connect with fans. The drive for discovery by "gaming the algorithm" through sensationalist content was unsustainable&#8212;and life-threatening.
                    <br><br>
                    And so Kimera was born: an engine to help aspiring creators achieve the dream we almost lost everything for. A dream to create stories that reach a passionate audience and build a relationship with fans to form the foundation of any creative career.
                    <br><br>
                    And at Kimera, we have never stopped creating&#8212;from vlogging our company's growth story on our YouTube channel to writing books on the creator economy.
                    <br><br>
                    As we build the future of creation, we never deviate from our First Principles: people over platforms, aligned incentives, and transparent simplicity&#8212;all under the notion that together we are boundless.
